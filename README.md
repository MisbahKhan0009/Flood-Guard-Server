# Flood Guard

## üåä Project Overview

Bangladesh is a country highly vulnerable to floods, facing mild to severe floods every year that lead to significant loss of life and financial damage. The **Flood Guard** project aims to develop a website that can forecast floods in advance, helping to mitigate these losses.

The website will assist flood victims in finding safe shelters and enable rescuers to provide them with essential support, such as food and medical supplies. It will feature a navigation system, allowing both victims and rescuers to easily find the quickest route to the nearest flood shelter.

We will use location-based forecasting to strive for the highest accuracy, ensuring the maximum number of lives are saved. Additionally, the site will integrate a mapping system to display the status of mobile towers near the user‚Äôs location. A prediction system will also help rescuers estimate the necessary amount of food and medicine.

## üìä Database Schema

The project's database schema is designed to store and manage the necessary data for effective flood management and support.
